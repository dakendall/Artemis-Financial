# Artemis-Financial
Artemis Financial

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  Artemis Financial is a consulting company that creates financial plans for clients. These plans include saviings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They are requesting an assistants on how to protect against external threats.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  The main issue I addressed for our client was updating the software that they were using such as the dependency check maven. It is important to protect against vulnerabilities that can lead to hacks and other types of attacks. It is very important for this company to make sure their information is secure because they are handling personal and financial information.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The challenging part was understanding which vulnerabilies were false-positives, but after reading the descriptions, it was easier to know which ones were false-positives.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  We increase security reviewing the code manually and with testing to find vulnerabilities. After that we came up with a plan to fix the vulnerabilites such as updating software. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
We ran the code, manually checked the code, and used the dependency check maven to look for vulnerabilites. Once they were discovered, we made changes to the code to prevent these vulnerabilies or we suppressed the false-positive vulnerabilies. After refactoring the code, we ran the code and test to check for new vulnerabilies and repeated the process.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  During the first discussion post, we read about different types of attacks that had already happened. I think it is a good idea to learn from experience, mine and others, so we can prevent the same things happening again.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  I think I can show future employers the knowledge I learned such has different vulnerabilies and how to test for them. I learned different types of algorithm ciphers and which ones are suited for which applications.
